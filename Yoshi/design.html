                Ever thought that Mario was overrated? Maybe <em>too</em> overrated?  
                Have you ever felt that Yoshi would make a better main character?
                He can jump. He can kick goomba butt. He can run fast. Maybeâ€¦Yoshi <em>is</em> better than Mario!
            </p>
            <p>
                Prove to the world that Yoshi is superior to Mario.
